	    		I am Nate Brevin A. Que and this is my Game Development Portfolio. 
	    	</h1>

	    	<div class="intro">
	    		<p>
	    			I am currently a <b>Fourth Year Computer Science / Game Development student</b>
	    			at the <b>Ateneo de Manila University</b>, expected to graduate on <b>June 2026</b>.
	    			In game development, I focus on the implementation of the <b>functionalities of the
	    			game</b> due to my interest in the technical side of programming in general.
	    			<br><br>
	    			This portfolio shows some of the <b>games</b> and <b>web applications</b> I worked
	    			on. These projects are mostly developed as <b>requirements in Ateneo</b> and <b>in
	    			Harvard's Introduction to Game Development (GD50) course</b> that was self-paced
	    			and was conducted online. It must be noted that many of the graphical features in
	    			these projects were implemented by other people, such as my team mates and the
	    			instructor from Harvard, but I was also able to implement some myself.

		    		<h2>GOAAAALL</h2>
		    		<div style='color:lightcoral;'>[lua, LOVE2D]</div>

		    		<p>
		    			This is a one-on-one football game wherein each player controls one character each.
		    			Each player bumps or kicks the ball to the opposing goal post to score a point and
		    			whoever scores more after 3 and a half minutes win. In case of a tie, there will
		    			be a sudden death, where the gameplay resumes from where it stopped as the timer
		    			went down to 0 and whoever scores first wins.

		    		<div style='color:lightcoral;'>[C#, UnityEngine]</div>
		    		<a href="https://github.com/BrevinQ42/ThirdPersonShooter">Link to GitHub repository</a>

		    		<p>
		    			This involves the core mechanics of a third person shooter, specifically player
		    			movement and look-around, both of which the camera follows, a weapon that shoots
		    			a projectile (like the red particles in the image) on command towards the target
		    			reticle, and objects--such as spheres in the image--that will be destroyed once
		    			it is shot a couple of times.

		    		<div style='color:lightcoral;'>[C#, UnityEngine]</div>
		    		<a href="https://github.com/BrevinQ42/Tile-Based-Movement">Link to GitHub repository</a>

		    		<p>
		    			This involves the core mechanics of a game that utilizes tile-based movement. Other
		    			than the basic movement in this implementation, this also includes tiles that force
		    			movement to a specific direction (arrow tiles), tiles that force movement based
		    			on which direction the player is facing (blood-like tiles), and walls (such as the
		    			volcano).

		    		<div style='color:lightcoral;'>[C#, UnityEngine]</div>
		    		<a href="https://github.com/BrevinQ42/Shmup">Link to GitHub repository</a>

		    		<p>
		    			This involves the core mechanics of a shoot 'em up (or shmup), which includes the
		    			player being able to control a character (the rectangle) that shoots projectiles
		    			(green lines) to destroy the enemies (the circles). The player has an HP, shown by
		    			the bar below the character model, which they have to preserve. The enemies, on the
		    			other hand, come from one side of the screen, and they continue to move towards the
		    			other side without pause, unless they are destroyed. They also shoot projectiles
		    			(red lines) back at the player.

		    		<h2>Angry 50: The Tri-shot Update</h2>
		    		<div style='color:lightcoral;'>[lua, LOVE2D]</div>

		    		<p>
		    			From the Harvard instructor's implementation of the core mechanics of Angry Birds, I
		    			added a new feature that allows the bird to spawn two more versions of itself above
		    			and below it, and the duplicates share the same velocity as the original one. In
		    			short, I added the mechanics of the small blue bird from the Angry Birds games.

		    		<a href="https://github.com/BrevinQ42/Platformer">Link to GitHub repository</a>

		    		<p>
		    			This involves the core mechanics of a platformer, which includes moving and
		    			stationary platforms, walls, items to be picked up (small white squares),
		    			and warps (pink squares) that teleport the player to a specific spot within
		    			the map. The camera also follows the player's movement; in my implementation,
		    			there is no camera drift.
